   ✅ Size limits and error handling

2. EMBEDDING & VECTOR SEARCH (src/services/embedding_service.py)
   ✅ OpenAI text-embedding-ada-002 integration
   ✅ FAISS IndexFlatIP for cosine similarity search
   ✅ Normalized embeddings for optimal performance
   ✅ Configurable similarity thresholds

3. LLM PROCESSING (src/services/llm_service.py)
   ✅ GPT-4 integration with domain-specific prompts
   ✅ Structured query extraction
   ✅ Clause logic evaluation
   ✅ Explainable answer generation

4. RETRIEVAL ORCHESTRATION (src/services/retrieval_service.py)
   ✅ End-to-end pipeline coordination
   ✅ Confidence scoring
   ✅ Batch processing capabilities
   ✅ Detailed explanations and metadata

5. API LAYER (main.py)
   ✅ FastAPI with async processing
   ✅ Bearer token authentication
   ✅ Comprehensive error handling
